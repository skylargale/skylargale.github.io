title: "Quantifying the Role of Internal Variability on Multidecadal Springtime Arctic Amplification Using Machine Learning"
excerpt: "My research uses machine learning (ML) to partition the role of internal variability in springtime AA. Applying ML to quantify springtime internal variability in observed Arctic and global temperature changes will significantly advance our knowledge in Arctic climate dynamics. This research will further shed light on how much internal variability contributes to the differences between observed and simulated AAs. It will also allow for a direct comparison of externally forced changes between observations and model simulations to inform about various feedback processes and their seasonal dependences. This research will help reshape climate science community thinking towards questions regarding the role of internal variability. The climate science community has struggled for years to characterize internal variability and its impact with a method that doesn’t inherently make unphysical assumptions. The proposed efforts to extract the influence of internal variability in springtime AA informs about how variable the climate system is and how much this variability can inflate or reduce temperature trends. Understanding how internal variability impacts AA aids in model predictions, which will benefit the Arctic climate change mitigation plans and local Arctic communities. AA is critical to study due to its impacts on humans and the environment, within and beyond the Arctic. For spring in particular, enhanced surface warming, sea ice melt, snow melt, and permafrost thawing can negatively impact human and animal activity. In a changing Arctic, local communities are seeing impacts on food and water accessibility and infrastructure damage. On the other hand, shipping routes, tourism, and fishing resources are becoming more accessible (Melia et al., 2016). The springtime Arctic ecosystem is experiencing changes in animal migration patterns and introduction of invasive species (CAFF 2013). Arctic ‘greening’ is becoming more apparent and decreasing the Arctic’s albedo as temperatures increase (Osborne et al., 2018). Springtime boreal wildfire frequency is and will continue to increase due to reduced snow and ice cover which leads to increased heat absorption (Heyblom et al., 2023). Increased seasonal sea ice loss also decreases the albedo while allowing disruptive algae to bloom in areas once protected by sea ice year-round (Osborne et al., 2018)."
