title: "Iceland's Disappearing Glaciers: How climate change affects the future of the Vatnajökull glacier in terms of dynamics, hydrology, and the consequences on Iceland’s hydroelectric potential and generation"
excerpt: "I provided an in-depth investigation and summarization of existing research on the Vatnajökull ice cap and its outlet glaciers, particularly the relationship between common climate change factors, the ice cap, and Iceland’s shifting hydrological system, with emphasis on climate change’s impact on the glaciological melting mechanisms of the Vatnajökull ice cap and the corresponding change in hydrology. This emphasis comes from a need to study glaciology to understand the tie between anthropological and environmental causes of climate change on glaciers and how these effects impact energy, power, and resources. This research provided insight into the planned construction designs that Iceland’s hydropower companies adopt to account for the changes in water flow from the melting Vatnajökull glacier."
