# A data-driven personal website
# ======
I graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics and a double minor in Applied Mathematics and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Colorado Boulder, Summa Cum Laude. I successfully defended my Honors Thesis on simulated relative sea level misfits in paleo-ice models against observations and the evaluation of glacial isostasy-constrained mantle viscosity profiles under Professor Shijie Zhong. During the summer of 2022, I completed a study abroad research program in Iceland. I researched glaciological impacts due to climate change and the corresponding effects on Iceland's hydrological system, focusing on the Vatnajökull ice cap. 

I have completed several internships and research projects to expand my knowledge of climate research and engineering solutions. In 2021, I interned with Lockheed Martin Space as a Planetary Science Instrumentation Research Intern. I worked with the GeoCarb instrument, a high-resolution research device that detects greenhouse gases to locate potential climate risks. I also completed an internship at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), where I explored the crossover between electrical engineering and climate science with the AirCore continuous in situ gas sampler.

I possess technical skills and expertise in CAD, 3D printing, scripting (C++, Python, Java, Fortran, MATLAB), modeling, imaging, mission design, and technical writing. I am dedicated to my work and strive for clear communication and collaboration in any environment.
