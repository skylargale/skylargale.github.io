I am a Ph.D. student in Atmospheric and Climate Science at the University of Washington, where I work with Professor Qiang Fu to understand the complex drivers of Arctic Amplification. My current research leverages machine learning techniques to quantify the seasonal role of internal variability in accelerated Arctic warming—a critical piece in the larger puzzle of climate predictability and response. My broader interests lie at the intersection of atmospheric-ice-snow interactions, climate modeling, polar climate variability, and the intensifying role of mid-latitude/boreal wildfires in a warming world. I am eager to contribute to forward-thinking research and data science efforts that advance both climate understanding and real-world resilience strategies.

I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Colorado Boulder in May 2023 with a B.S. in Engineering Physics and minors in Applied Mathematics and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Under the mentorship of Professor Shijie Zhong, I completed and defended an Honors Thesis focused on simulated relative sea level misfits in paleo-ice models, assessing how glacial isostasy-constrained mantle viscosity profiles affect our interpretation of past ice sheet dynamics. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Iceland, where I conducted field-based research on glaciological changes and their hydrological impacts, particularly related to the Vatnajökull ice cap—an experience that deepened both my scientific and cultural perspectives on climate change.

My research background is supported by a range of interdisciplinary experiences. As a Planetary Science Instrumentation Intern at Lockheed Martin Space, I contributed to the GeoCarb mission, working on high-resolution greenhouse gas detection for climate monitoring. At NOAA, I investigated the integration of atmospheric sampling technologies like AirCore with electrical engineering approaches, highlighting the value of cross-domain innovation in climate science.

I bring a diverse technical toolkit to my work—including CAD, 3D printing, scientific programming (Python, C++, Java, Fortran, MATLAB), data modeling, imaging, and mission design—paired with strong technical writing and communication skills. I’m passionate about clear, collaborative science and dedicated to research that bridges the gap between data and decision-making in a changing climate.

Outside of research, I find balance and inspiration in the outdoors. I’m an avid runner, skier (resort and backcountry), hiker, swimmer, cyclist, and volleyball player. Nature keeps me grounded and reminds me why climate research matters. When I’m not on a trail or in the office, you’ll probably find me watching films—I'm a bit of a movie critic—and enjoying time with my family and dogs. These moments of connection and reflection keep me energized and centered.
